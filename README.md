# Retail Demand Forecasting

This project demonstrates end-to-end demand forecasting for retail sales using machine learning (XGBoost) and traditional time series models (ARIMA). It covers all key steps: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict daily sales to optimize inventory, reduce stockouts/overstock, and inform business decisions.
- **Dataset:** Ecommerce Dataset 2024
- **Tech Stack:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, statsmodels).

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Remove nulls, aggregate sales, create time-based features, handle missing dates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  Visualize sales by month, weekday, trends, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Lag features, rolling means, time-based flags (month, weekday, weekend, year).
- **Modeling Approaches:**  
  - **XGBoost Regression:** Handles seasonality, lags, and engineered features.
  - **ARIMA:** Classic time series model for direct sales prediction.
- **Evaluation:**  
  Compare MAE, RMSE, and forecast plots for both models.
- **Visualizations:**  
  - Sales seasonality
  - Rolling averages
  - Feature importances
  - Actual vs Predicted (side-by-side)
  - Combined model comparison
